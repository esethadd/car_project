Hello! 
This is a personal project that will allow me to read the various data from my car such as Fuel Pressure, Engine Load, Coolant Temperature, etc. In the future I may want to
turn this into a project where I can display these values via bluetooth, but for now these values are displayed on a LCD1602 module with only four data points
--RPM, Speed, Coolant Temperature, and Throttle Position.
